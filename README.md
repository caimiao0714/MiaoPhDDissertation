# Modeling Truck Drivers' Critical Events: Efficient Bayesian Hierarchical Models

To do list 2019-10-30:

(1) Aim 1  Association between crashes and safety-critical events: finished and submitted to [Transportation Research Part C	](https://www.evise.com/co-author/?dgcid=invite_email_coauthoroutreach0968090X#/non/overview)

(2) Aim 2 Predictive modeling of safety-critical events among 500 drivers
    - [ ] Remake the `segment()` function using `data.table`.
    - [ ] Exploratory results for 500 drivers.
    - [ ] Can we account for real-time characteristics within a shift for a PLP.

(3) Aim 3 Jump-point power law process
    - [ ] Figure out the math for JPLP.
