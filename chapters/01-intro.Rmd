# INTRODUCTION

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package  to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:


Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).
