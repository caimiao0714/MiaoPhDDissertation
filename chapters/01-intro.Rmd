INTRODUCTION
============

Transportation safety
---------------------

Traffic safety is a pressing public health issue that involves huge losses of lives and financial burden across the world. 
As reported by the World Health Organization [@who2018], road injury was the eighth cause of death globally in 2016, killing approximately 1.4 million people, which consisted of about 2.5% of all deaths in the world. 
If no sustained action is taken, road injuries are predicted to be the seventh leading cause of death across the world by 2030 [@who2018b]. 
Compared to the victims who were claimed lives by diseases, people killed in traffic are mostly   early- or middle-aged, particularly those aged 4 to 44 years old [@litman2013transportation; @evans2014traffic].
Without traffic accidents, these victims could have much longer lives with normal quality of life

Apart from fatal deaths, road traffic injuries were also reported to be the cause of 50 million non-fatal life injuries and approximately 75.5 million disability-adjusted life years globally [@staton2016road].
In high-income countries, the majority of non-death costs were attributable to non-fatal crashes, with 2% of non-fatal events leading to over 40% of life-time medical costs [@ameratunga2006road].
Besides non-fatal injuries, traffic safety is a major economic burden. 
The global economic losses attributable to transportation safety were estimated to be 518 billion United States Dollars (USD), which accounted for 1% the gross domestic product (GDP) in low-income countries, 1.5% in middle-income countries, and 2% in high-income countries [@peden2004world; @dalal2013economics]. 

Specifically in the United States, transportation contributed to the highest number of fatal occupational injuries, leading to 2,077 deaths and accounting for over 40% of all fatal occupational injuries in 2017 [@bols]. 
The National Safety Council reported that the number of deaths attributable to car crashes will be at least 40,000 in 2018, which is the third straight year that this number is over 40,000 [@nsc2018]. 
Despite large amounts of investments in roads, improved vehicle protection and traffic policy implementation, and advanced emergency and trauma care, the reduction in traffic associated fatality rates is nominal [@litman2013transportation].
If the change of traffic fatality rates in the US match those in other unremarkable countries, 20,000 traffic deaths could have been prevented each year [@evans2014traffic].


The impact of road injuries is even more impactful in developing countries than in developed countries [@goonewardene2010road].
Although low- and middle-income countries own only 48% of all the registered vehicles in the world, 90% of road traffic fatalities and injuries were estimated to occur in these countries, which continue to be escalating due to rapid urbanization and motorization [@dalal2013economics; @staton2016road].
Ten developing countries, including Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, India, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and Vietnam, account for almost half of all the road traffic in the world [@hyder2012addressing]. 
For example, China has around 100,000 traffic-related fatalities each year [@zhang2010road], accounting for around 80% of all accidental deaths, with 87% of them caused by motor vehicles in 2015 [@jiang2017transport]. 
In comparison, 148,707 lives were claimed by road collisions in India in 2015, with the road fatality rate similar to the global average level of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 people [@india2015].



Truck safety
------------

In the US, the large commercial truck industry is the backbone of the economy. Approximately 70% of freight is delivered via a truck at some point of their transportation, which account for 73.1% of value and 71.3% of volume of the domestic goods [@olson2016weight; @anderson2017exploratory]. 
However, large trucks are associated with more catastrophic accidents among all vehicles, so they  are the primary concern of traffic safety. In 2016, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) reported that 27% fatal crashes in work zones involved large trucks [@fmcsareport2016]. Among all 4,079 crashes involving large trucks or buses in 2016, 4,564 people (1.12 people per crash) were killed [@fmcsafacts2016]. Large truck crashes approximately claim 5,000 lives and cause 120,000 injuries each year, but only 15% of these fatalities occur in the trucks, with a predominate 78% occurred in the other vehicles [@neeley2009effect]. Besides, the economic losses associated with large truck crashes are also higher than those with passenger vehicles, with an estimated average cost of 91,000 USD per crash [@zaloshnja2008unit]. 

The high risk of large trucks is attributed to two aspects of reasons [@huang2013development]. First, large truck drivers generally need to drive alone for long routes, under on-time demands, and challenging weather and traffic conditions. Professional truck drivers usually need to work in shifts, and sometimes unavoidable late-night or early-morning shifts [@pylkkonen2015sleepiness], which have been reported to be associated with sleep deprivation and disorders [@aakerstedt1988sleepiness; @mitler1997sleep; @solomon2004healthcare; @sallinen2005sleepiness]. Besides, the long route, constant concentration, and overtime work,  intertwine with sleep deprivation and disorder and induce the fatigue symptoms among truck drivers.  It is estimated that fatigue among long distance truck drivers caused up to 31% of single vehicle fatal truck crashes [@ntsb1990; @mitler1997sleep]. 

On the other hand, trucks have huge weights, large physical dimensions, and potentially carry hazardous cargoes. Although these huge-size trucks boost the transportation efficiency by increasing cargo capacity and reducing fuel costs per trip, they also raise public safety concerns [@lemp2011analysis]. Large trucks can weight up to 80,000 pounds by federal law, which are twenty times as heavy as a normal-weight passenger vehicle [@utah2019]. If these trucks travel at the speed of 65 miles per hour on the highway, it will take them around 525 feet to stop, which is about two times the length of a football field [@utah2019]. The large physical size also creates large blind spots on both sides of the truck, which poses more threat on smaller-sized vehicles. When a crash occurs between a large truck and a smaller vehicle, the sheer size and weight of the truck result in the tragedy that the victims are from the smaller vehicle instead of from the trucks in around 80% of the cases [@neeley2009effect]. In even worse case, commercial trucks crashes can cause massive casualties and regional public health emergency when the carried hazardous materials are leaked (such as gasoline and sulfuric acid).

The importance of truck industry and the potential catastrophic consequences underscore the need to reduce crash risk and improve the safety of truck transportation.


Modern truck safety studies
---------------------------

To reduce the lives and economic losses associated with trucks, numerous studies attempted to accurately identify the risk factors for truck-related traffic crashes and make accurate prediction. However, there are several limitations of studies using crash data. First, traffic crashes are characterized by rare events (dozens to thousands of times fewer crashes than non-crashes) [@theofilatos2016predicting; @theofilatos2018impact]. To tackle this rare-event issue, the most common study design is a case-control study, which matches a crash with one to up to ten non-crashes, and then use statistical models such as logistic regressions to explain the causes or predict the crashes [@braver1997tractor; @chen2014modeling; @meuleners2015obstructive; @nee2019road]. Unfortunately, a case-control study is limited in estimating incidence rates or overall average treatment effect. It may be contentious in selecting the ratio of controls to cases and how to select these controls [@grimes2005compared; @sedgwick2014case]. Second, due to the retrospective nature of crash data, it is unrealistic to trace back to the real-time traffic, weather, and other environmental factors that were associated with the crashes. Most of crash data reported by police and associated drivers were subject to recall and misinformation bias [@girotto2016professional]. Third, crashes are underreported, especially for those with no or minor injuries or economic losses [@ye2011investigation]. The National Highway Traffic Safety Adminitration estimated that 25% of minor-injury crashes and 50% of no-injury crashes were not reported, compared to nearly 100% reporting rate for fatal crashes [@savolainen2011statistical].

Past truck safety literature almost exclusively focused on crashes, while ignoring precursors to crashes. A precursor to crashes, also known as safety critical events (SCEs), adverse events, or near-miss crashes, is an emerging pattern or signature associated with an increasing chance of crashes [@saleh2013accident; @janakiraman2016discovery]. Truck SCEs deserve more attention since they occur more frequently than crashes, potentially suggest fatigue and a lapse in performance, and can lead to catastrophic crashes [@dingus2006development]. 

Proposal
--------

With the rapid development of modern technology, more real-time naturalistic driving and SCEs data have been collected by commercial truck companies [@janakiraman2016discovery]. With advanced unobstrusive instrumentation, these data provide a unique opportunity to continuously study real-world driving performance and potential consequences [@dingus2016driver]. Naturalistic driving data can be further used to examine the risk factors associated with truck crashes, by fusing high-resolution data on the risk factors, such as driver behavior, vehicle condition, traffic, weather, and road geometry [@guo2019statistical].

This prospectus proposal focuses on Bayesian hierarchical statistical and reliability models based on a large truck naturalistic driving data. The three specific research aims are:

1) quantify the association between truck crashes and SCEs,
2) construct scalable Bayesian hierarchical statistical and reliability models for truck critical events,
3) innovate the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) with power law process (PLP) intensity function to account for short rests between different trips.

I believe that this work will contribute to statistical theories in constructing scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to perform Bayesian hierarchical statistical and reliability models. Realistically, these statistical models will provide insights into the relationship between crashes and SCEs, as well as SCEs and driver characteristics, traffic, weather, and other real-time driving environmental variables. These statistical models can be further used to provide data-driven evidence to optimize trucking routes, minimize unsafe driving behavior, and improve a safe driving environment.
