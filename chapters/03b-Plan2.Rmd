Analytical Plan for Aim 2
-------------------------

The purpose of aim 2 is to develop three scalable hierarchical Bayesian statistical and reliability models for the SCEs of truck drivers. Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression, Poisson regression, and NHPP with the PLP intensity function will be used. All three models will account for both driver-level and trip-level variation. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with energy conserving subsampling (HMC-ECS) proposed by @dang2019hamiltonian will be used to scale the hierarchical model in a Bayesian setting.

In the three proposed models, vehicle drivers will be viewed as the sampling unit. The workflow is to sample a certain number of drivers from a population of drivers, observe their driving trips or shifts for a specific period, then compare the safety events with non-events, and make conclusions on risk factors associated with these safety events.  The details of the statistical models will be explained in the following sections.

### Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression {#hierarchical-logit}

Here the probability of a critical event occurred will be modeled using a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression, as shown in Equation \@ref(eq:hierarchicallogit). I will categorize the number of safety events during a trip into a binary variable $Y_{i, d}$ of either 0 or 1, where 0 indicates that no critical event occurred during that trip while 1 indicates that at least 1 critical event occurred during the trip. The analysis will be based on the merged 30-minute interval data, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:analysis30int).
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Y_{i} &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{i})\\
\log\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}} &= \beta_{0, d(i)} + \beta_{1, d(i)} \cdot \text{CT}_i + \sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{ij}\beta_j\\
\beta_{0, d} &\sim \text{i.i.d. } N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2), \quad d = 1, 2, \cdots, D\\
\beta_{1, d} &\sim \text{i.i.d. } N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2), \quad d = 1, 2, \cdots, D
(\#eq:hierarchicallogit)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where $\mu_0, \sigma_0$ are hyper-parameters for $\beta_{0, d}$, $\mu_1, \sigma_1$ are hyper-parameters for random slope $\beta_{1, d}$, $\beta_2, \beta_3, \cdots, \beta_J$ are fixed parameters for covariates $x_{ij}$.

Since we do not have much prior knowledge on the parameters, I will assign weakly informative priors [@gelman2017prior] for these parameters shown in Equation \@ref(eq:prior).
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		\mu_0 & \sim N(0, 5^2)\\
		\mu_1 & \sim N(0, 5^2)\\
		\sigma_0 & \sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)\\
		\sigma_1 & \sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)\\
		\beta_2, \beta_3, \cdots, \beta_J  & \sim N(0, 10^2)
		(\#eq:prior)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Since $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$ can be any real number, so we assigned two normal distributions with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 10 as the priors for these two hyperparameters. In comparison, $\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_1$ must be strictly positive, so we assigned GAMMA$(1, 1)$ with wide distribution on positive real numbers as their priors.

### Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression

The logistic regression considers whether SCEs occurred in a 30-minute fixed interval or not, but it ignores the intensity of the critical events. Here I present a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression to model the effect of cumulative driving time on the occurrence of critical events, as shown in Equation \@ref(eq:hierarchicalpoisson). Each driver will have a different a random slope on cumulative driving time and a random intercept. The analysis will also be based on the merged 30-minute interval data, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:analysis30int).
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
N_{i}  & \sim \text{Poisson}(T_i\cdot\lambda_i)\\
\log\lambda_{i} & =\beta_{0, d(i)} + \beta_{1, d(i)} \cdot \text{CT}_i + \sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{ij}\beta_j\\
\beta_{0, d} &\sim \text{i.i.d. } N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2), \quad d = 1, 2, \cdots, D\\
\beta_{1, d} &\sim \text{i.i.d. } N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2), \quad d = 1, 2, \cdots, D
(\#eq:hierarchicalpoisson)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Where $N$ is the number of critical events for driver $d(i)$ in time interval $j$, and it has a Poisson distribution with the mean and variance parameter $\lambda$. $T_i$ is the length of the time interval, with most of them are 30 minutes. The other variables are identical as those described in Equation . Compared to the hierarchical logistic regression in Section \@ref(hierarchical-logit), the predictor variables are identical with those in Equation \@ref(eq:hierarchicallogit) and the only thing that is changed here is the outcome distribution. Therefore, I will assign identical prior distributions as specified in Equation \@ref(eq:prior).

### Non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP)

Despite Poisson regression consider the frequency of SCEs in a given interval, it assumes that the intensity of events is a constant, which may not be true in real-life transportation practice. Here I present a reliability model, a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) with a power law process (PLP) based on the merged shifts data set. The aim is to answer if SCEs occurred more frequently at early stages of shifts, towards the end of shifts, or does not show significant patterns.

```{r arrowplot, fig.cap='An arrow plot of time to SCEs in each shift', echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="0.8\\linewidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/NHPP_arrow_plot.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:arrowplot) shows a sample of SCEs distributions in different shifts. Each arrow represents a shift while each red cross shows a SCE. This type of recurrent events data fit into the analysis framework of point process and reliability models. A point process is a stochastic model which describes the occurrence of events in a given period [@rigdon2000statistical]. The mean function of a point process is $\Lambda(t) = E(N(t))$, where $\Lambda(t)$ is the expected number of failures through time $t$. Two notations that are important in reliability models are *Rate of Occurence of Failures (ROCOF)* and *Intensity function*.

1. *ROCOF*: When the mean function $\Lambda(t)$ is differentiable, the ROCOF is $\mu(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\Lambda(t)$. The ROCOF can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change in the expected number of failures.
2. *Intensity function*: The intensity function of a point process is 
$\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{P(N(t, t+\Delta t] \geq 1)}{\Delta t}$. When there is no simultaneous events, ROCOF is the same as intensity function.

A commonly used reliability model is the *Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)*. The NHPP is a Poisson process whose intensity function is non-constant. The Power law process (PLP) is a special case of a NHPP when the intensity function of a NHPP is:
\begin{equation}
\lambda(t) = \frac{\beta}{\theta}\bigg(\frac{t}{\theta}\bigg)^{\beta-1},
(\#eq:plp)
\end{equation}
Where $\beta > 0$ and $\theta > 0$, the process is called the power law process (PLP), also called the Weibull intensity function. Therefore, the mean function $\Lambda(t)$ is the integral of the intensity function: $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(t)dt = \int_0^t \frac{\beta}{\theta}\bigg(\frac{t}{\theta}\bigg)^{\beta-1} = \bigg(\frac{t}{\theta}\bigg)^{\beta}$.

There are two forms of truncation in a NHPP: 1) *Failure truncation* when testing stops after a predetermined number of failures, 2) *Time truncation* when testing stops at a predetermined time $t$. In a time truncated case, the joint likelihood function for $f(n, t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n)$ is shown in Equation \@ref(eq:pdftau) (the prove can be found at page 54 in @rigdon2000statistical).
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f(n, t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n) & = f(n)f(t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n|n)\\
& = \frac{e^{-\int_0^\tau \lambda(u)du}[\int_0^\tau \lambda(u)du]^n}{n!}n!\frac{\prod_{i=1}^n\lambda(t_i)}{[\Lambda(\tau)]^n}\\
& = \Big(\prod_{i=1}^n\lambda(t_i) \Big)e^{-\int_0^\tau \lambda(u)du}\\
& = \Big(\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{\beta}{\theta}(\frac{t_i}{\theta})^{\beta - 1} \Big)e^{-(\tau/\theta)^\beta},\\ 
n & = 0, 1, 2, \cdots, \quad  0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_n
(\#eq:pdftau)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With the joint likelihood function of a NHPP, we can specify our statistical models. Let $T_{d, s, i}$ denote the time to the $d$-th driver's $s$-th shift's $i$-th critical event. The total number critical events of $d$-th driver's $s$-th shift is $n_{d,s}$. The ranges of these notations are: 

- $i = 1, 2, \cdots, n_{d, S_d}$,
- $s = 1, 2, \cdots, S_d$,
- $d = 1, 2, \cdots, D$.

We assumes that the times of critical events within the $d$-th driver's $s$-th shift were generated from a PLP, with a fixed shape parameter $\beta$ and varying scale parameters $\theta_{d, s}$ across drivers $d$ and shifts $s$. In a PLP, the intensity function of the NHPP is $\lambda(t) =  \frac{\beta}{\theta}(\frac{t}{\theta})^{\beta-1}$. The model is described in Equation \@ref(eq:nhpp).
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  T_{d, s, 1}, T_{d, s, 2}, \cdots , T_{d, s, n_{d, s}} & \sim \text{PLP}(\beta, \theta_{d, s})\\
  \beta & \sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)\\
  \log\theta_{d, s} &= \gamma_{0d} + \gamma_{1}x_{d, s, 1} + \gamma_{2}x_{d, s, 2} + \cdots + \gamma_{k}x_{d, s, k}\\
  \gamma_{01}, \gamma_{02}, \cdots, \gamma_{0D} & \sim \text{i.i.d. }N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)\\
  \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \cdots, \gamma_k & \sim \text{i.i.d. }N(0, 10^2)\\
  \mu_0 &\sim N(0, 10^2) \\
  \sigma_0 &\sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)
(\#eq:nhpp)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The shape parameter $\beta$ shows the reliability changes of drivers. When $\beta > 1$, the intensity function $\lambda(t)$ is increasing, the reliability of drivers is  decreasing, and SCEs are becoming more frequent; when $\beta < 1$, the intensity function $\lambda(t)$ is decreasing, the reliability of drivers is increasing, and SCEs are becoming less frequent; when $\beta = 1$, the NHPP is simplified as a homogeneous Poisson process with the intensity of $1/\theta$. The $\theta_{d, s}$ is a scale parameter that does not reflect reliability changes.


All data reduction, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization will be done on the RStudio Server and Jupyter Server on the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC). The OSC provides high performance computing resources and expertise to academic researchers [@OSC1987]. The scalable Bayesian statistical and reliability models using the HMC-ECS algorithm will be conducted using the `rstan` package in R 3.5.1 or self-write Python programs [@rstancitation; @Rcitation; @dang2019hamiltonian].
