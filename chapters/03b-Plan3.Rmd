Analytical Plan for Aim 3
-------------------------

Aim 3 seeks to innovate the NHPP proposed in Aim 2 by accounting for the rest time within a shift. One more parameter, the percent of reliability recovery during a break within a shift, will be estimated for in this model.

This new model will be between a non-homogeneous Poisson process where the intensity function is not influenced by between-trip rests ("as bad as old"), and a renewal process where the intensity function is fully recovered by between-trip rests ("as good as new")

### Modulate PLP

The modulated PLP by @black1996statistical gives an alternative plan for achieving Aim 3.
