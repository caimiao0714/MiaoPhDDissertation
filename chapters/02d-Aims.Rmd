The overarching goal of this proposed dissertation is to contruct scalable Bayesian hierarchical models for NDS data and understand how cumulative driving time and other factors will impact the performance of truck drivers. However, there are several gaps in traffic safety studies based on the previous literature review. First, an increasing number of studies are using SCEs as the outcome variable, but *the association between crashes and SCEs has not been confirmed*. Second, SCEs are much more common and there can be multiple SCEs within a short period, but *recurrent events models were not widely applied* to understand the risk factors for SCEs. Third, *the high-resolutional and high-dimensional data collected by NDS poses a challenge to Bayesian estimation*. Considering these limitations, the aims of this research will focus on developing innovative and scalable Bayesian hierarchical statistical and reliability models to understand NDS data. Accordingly, the specific aims of this dissertation are as follows:

1. **Aim1: To examine the association between truck crashes and SCEs using a Bayesian Gamma-Poisson regression**. I hypothesize that the rate of crashes is positively associated with the rate of SCEs among the truck drivers controlling for the miles driven.

2. **Aim2: To construct three scalable Bayesian hierarchical models to identify  potential risk factors for SCEs**. I hypothesis that the patterns of SCEs vary significantly from drivers to drivers and can be predicted using risk factors including cumulative driving time, weather, road geometry, age, and others.
    + **Sub-aim 1: to contruct a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression to model whether SCEs will occur in 30-minute intervals**. I hypothesis that the probability of SCEs is positively associated with the cumulative driving time and risk factors, and it varies significantly from drivers to drivers.
    + **Sub-aim 2: to contruct a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression to model whether SCEs will occur in 30-minute intervals**. I hypothesis that the rate of SCEs is positively associated with the cumulative driving time and risk factors, and it varies significantly from drivers to drivers.
    + **Sub-aim 3: to contruct a Bayesian hierarchical non-homogeneous Poisson process with the power law process intensity function to model the intensity change of SCEs within each shift**. I hypothesis that the intensity of SCEs it increases in later stage of shifts, can be predicted by the risk factors, and it varies from drivers to drivers and is .

3. **Aim3: To propose an innovative reliability model that accounts for both within shift cumulative driving time and between-trip rest time**. I hypothesis that between-trip rest time can recover the intensity function by some proportion or by a certain amount, and intensity function varies significantly from drivers to drivers.
