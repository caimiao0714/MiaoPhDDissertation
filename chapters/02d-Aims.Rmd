Gaps in literature
------------------

- A focus on crashes instead of precursors of crashes
- A focus on road segments rather than drivers
- A focus on case-control comparison given the rareness of truck crashes rather than rates

Research aims
-------------

1. **Aim1**: Explore the association between truck crashes and critical events.


2. **Aim2**: Predict critical events using hierarchical statistical models.


3. **Aim3**: scalable hierarchical Bayesian models using subsampling MCMC.
