Conceptual framework
--------------------

@cantor2010driver suggested three factors that cause truck crashes: driver factors, vehicle factors (type and condition), and environmental factors.

@roshandel2015impact proposed five factors that affect traffic safety: (a)  behavioral characteristics of the driver, e.g., impairment, fatigue, distractions; (b) vehicle --- the condition of the vehicle; (c) traffic --- the traffic conditions; (d) geometry --- geometric characteristics of the road, e.g. curve, hill, ramps, etc.; and (e) environmental --- characteristics of the surrounding environment, such as weather conditions (rain, snow, night-time driving, etc.). Traffic conditions are the most studied of these and we focus on discussing them in this subsection.

Previous studies suggested that driver behavior can contribute to over 90% of crashes [@dingus2016driver; @guo2019statistical]. A recent report by the @nhtsa2013national revealed that human error was the criticval reason for 93% of crashes.
