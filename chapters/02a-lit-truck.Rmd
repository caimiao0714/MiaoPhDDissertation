LITERATURE REVIEW

Precursors to crashes
---------------------
Truck crash data have several limitations. Firstly, truck crashes are extremely rare compared with non-crashes. According to the @fmcsareport2017, large truck and bus fatalities in 2017 were 0.156 per million travelled vehicle miles, which was a 6.8 percent increase from 2016. This rareness poses a challenge to infer unbiased estimates using traditional statistical models [@guo2010near; @theofilatos2018impact]. Secondly, most truck crash data reply on post hoc police reports. Although these data are generally accurate and detailed by police officers, they are limited in determining the information of the driver in the meaningful time period leading up to the crash [@dingus2011estimating]. Some of the critical factors, such as distraction, are not reported or cannot be determined due to a varitety of reasons [@dingus2011estimating]. Thirdly, truck crashes are underreported, particularly for no-injury and minor-injury crashes [@ye2011investigation; @stern2019data]. It is estimated that 25% of minor-injury and 50% of non-injury crashes were not reported, while 100% of fatal crashes were reported [@savolainen2011statistical].

In light of the aforementioned limitations, a growing number of literature is using naturalistic driving data to identify crash causation and develop effective crash countermeasures [@dingus2006100; @klauer2009comparing; @guo2010near; @hickman2010distraction]. These studies use unobstrusive devices installed on vehicles to collect real-time driving behavior and and performance. Instead of collecting extremely rare vehicle crash data, these studies focus on near-crash events, defined as events that used last-second successful evasive maneuver that avoided crashes [@dingus2011estimating]. Although these near-crashes were not real crashes, these studies suggested that they are predictive crashes [@dingus2011estimating; @guo2010near].

A more formal definition of near-crash, or the more general accident precursor, in safety analysis and accident prevention field was proposed in @saleh2013accident. An accident precursor was defined as a chain of adverse events following an initial off-nominal event, which can result in an accident if compounded with additional adverse conditions [@saleh2013accident]. A near-crash or near miss is a special case of accident precursor, with the feature of being close to a complete accident sequence. Accidence precursor has been widely studies in certain safety science in which the accidents are extremely rare, such as nuclear industry [@smith2007decision], chemistry [@phimister2003near], and aerospace industry [@kirwan2008human]. However, there are limited number of studies in accident precursors in the truck safety field.

Naturalistic driving data
-------------------------

The first large-scale NDS was The 100-Car Naturalistic Driving study conducted in North Virginia, the United States [@neale2005overview].


@knipling2015naturalistic challenges the validity of naturalistic driving data.

Risk factors
------------

### Fatigue

Among all driver-related safety events, fatigue has become the most pressing problem of truck accidents. It is estimated by National Sleep Foundation that approximately 32% of drivers drive with fatigue over twice a month [@nsleepf]. The American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety claimed that 16.5% of fatal traffic accidents and 12.5% of injuries-related collisions were associated with driving with fatigue in 2010 [@aaafoundation].  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that 60% of fatal truck crashes were attributable to the driver falling asleep while driving [@craye2016multi; @cavuoto2017understanding].

Fatigue is often defined as a multidimensional process that leads to diminished worker performance, which may be a result of prolonged work, psychological, socioeconomic, and environment factors [@yung2016fatigue; @cavuoto2017understanding]. However, this definition has low specificity since there are other factors associated with a decreased worker performance, such as cell phone use, which does not result in driver fatigue. There is no uniform and succint definition on fatigue since it involves interactions between biological, behavior, and psychological process. A comprehensive review on fatigue definition and measurement is provided by @yung2016fatigue.

The mechanism of fatigue leading to traffic safety events is that the driver’s capability to stay alert to ambient traffic and pedestrians will be largely impaired. The reaction time is subsequently prolonged in that situation [@zhang2014study]. It is estimated that 17 hours of continuous working lead to a deterioration of driving performance equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.05% [@maclean2003hazards]. What makes the outcomes worse is that fatigue driving is more likely to happen on expressways and major highways where the speed limit is over 55 miles per hour [@knipling1994crashes]. This is especially concerning because fatigue driving safety critical events are more likely to result in serious injuries and fatalities, compared with non-fatigue driving safety critical events.

Although fatigue has been recognized as the primary reason for traffic safety, little has been done about drowsy driving since there is no simple way to objectively measure fatigue driving [@dement1997perils]. In view of the difficulty of measuring fatigue, researchers have attempted to  use different proxies of fatigue associated with truck drivers. @stern2019data reviewed the research related to the fatigue of commercial motor vehicle drivers. 

Numerous studies used ocular metrics, such as eye closure and blinking patterns, to detect driver's fatigue [@golias2013evaluating]. For example, @jackson2016utility measured the eyelid closure of 22 healthy participants with 24 hours of sleep deprivation. They found a significant increase in proportions of time with closed eyeclids after the sleep deprivation, which were significantly associated with crashes, Psychomotor Vigilance Task lapses, and subjective sleepiness scores (95% confidence interval of Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.46 to 0.69).

Other studies used physiological measures, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate, as indicators of fatigue [@golias2013evaluating]. It has been demonstrated that awake but drowsy truck drivers during working have increased alpha and theta power densities in EEG [@kecklund1993sleepiness; @cajochen1995power; @mitler1997sleep]. The variability of heart rates has been identified as passive proxy of fatigue among drivers [@mulder1992measurement; @patel2011applying].

Working load, such as cumulative driving time, is also measure of the fatigue of drivers. For example, @nakayama2002trial found that there was a significant increase in the fatigue of drivers after 12 hours of continuous driving.  @jovanis2011hours used cumulative hours of driving, time of the day, driving patterns over multiple days, rests after driving, and the 34-hour recovery policy as measures of driver fatigue. They found that more driving time was associated with increased odds of crashes among 686 less-than-truck-load drivers (224 crash-involved drivers and 464 randomly sampled non-crash drivers from the same terminal in the same month), with the highest odds in the 11-th hour. From the fifth hour to the 11th hour, the odds of crashes were consistently increasing [@jovanis2012effects]. In contrast, @soccolich2013analysis found no significant difference in safety outcomes between the 11th driving hour and driving hours 8, 9, or 10 using from the Naturalistic Truck Driving Study data. Desipte the fact that working hours were not significant, they suggested an interaction between driving hours and working hours: a work day that starts with several hours of non-driving work and then followed by 14 hours of driving was significantly associated with risk of safety-critical events.

Lack of sleep or specific sleep patterns have also been used as proxies of fatigue. For example, @chen2016influence used negative binomial regression to identify the association between four sleep patterns and driving performance based on the Naturalistic Truck Driving Study data. They revealed that shorter sleep, early-stage sleep in a non-work period, and insufficient sleep between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. were associated with increased safety-critical event rates. @sparrow2016naturalistic reported that truck drivers with a retart break of only one nighttime period (defined as 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.) experienced more lapses of attention, elevated lane deviation at night, and higher sleepiness measured by subjective questionnaires.


A significant amount of research emphasizes the association between time of the day (such as night driving) and the development of fatigue[@cavuoto2017understanding]. Night drving is often accompanied by changes in shift scheduling, inadequate sleep, sleep apnea and disorder. For example, @pack1995characteristics reported that the crashes in which the drivers fell asleep occurred primarily from mid-night to 7 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.. @mitler1997sleep monitored 80 truck drivers in North America using 24-hour electrophysiologic measures. They found that drivers an average had 5.18 hours of sleep in bed per day and 4.78 hours of electrophysiologically validated sleep per day, which were significantly less than needed to stay alert on job. It was also suggested that late-night or early-morning work were detrimental to the drivers' sleep. @pahukula2015time investigated the risk factors associated with crashes on Texas urban freeways between 2006 and 2010. They ran separate random-effects logistic regressions on five time periods: early morning (12 a.m. to 4 a.m.), morning (5 a.m. to 9 a.m.), mid-day (10 a.m. to 3 p.m.), afternoon (4 p.m. to 8 p.m.), and evening (9 p.m. to 11 p.m.). The results revealed major differences in traffic flow, light conditions, surface conditions, time of year, and the percentage of trucks on road among the five different models.


### Driver characteristics

A study by @pack1995characteristics revealed that the drivers were 25 years of age or younger in over a half of the 5,000 highway crashes in which they fell asleep whiling driving. Age-related safety [@duke2010age]. Teenager driver [@ouimet2014higher]. Another driver-related risk factor of driving safety critical events is the age of drivers. It is reported that younger drivers will experience more crashes than older drivers [@cantor2010driver]. 


On the other hand, older drivers can also experience an increased risk of crash. To meet the huge demand services and supply chain management, it is very common to extend the retirement age or reemploy retired workers in developing countries [@popkin2008age]. Aging drivers increase the chance of the safety critical events in three aspects: impaired eyesight, prolonged reaction time to exogenous stimuli, and vulnerability to fatigue [@di2011demographic]. Aged drivers are associated with eyesight diseases or functionality impairment, such as cataracts, narrowed peripheral vision and decreasing visual acuity [@di2011demographic]. In addition, working for truck companies often means irregular shifts and taking the night schedules, which disrupt the circadian time-keeping systems, especially for the aged workers [@moneta1996time]. 

Aged drivers may find it much more difficult to adjust for the sleep-wake cycle to keep pace with the schedule required by the employer company. Therefore, this disruption of the circadian systems, in turn, increases the chances to feel sleepy or fatigue for workers. It is indicated by research that the “critical age” of shiftwork intolerance is about 45 to 50 years, at which sleep disorder, persisting fatigue and digestive problems become the most obvious [@di2011demographic]. Young drivers are much better in the sense of physical health and resistance to fatigue compared with aged drivers, however, they are more vulnerable regarding the experience of driving. A study conducted by Clarke suggested that young drivers (17 – 19 years old), especially males, have significantly more accidents than other drivers during the hours of darkness, on rural curves, and rear-end shunts compared with male drivers aged 20 -25 years [@clarke2006young]. The reasons for these young driver accidents were not fully explained, but could largely be attributed to inexperience.

One more risk factor that could explain driving safety critical events is drivers’ gender. Gender has been suggested to be related with outcomes in medical treatment, education, sports and other fields, and there is no exception for truck drivers’ safety. In the first place, women are more likely to suffer from fatigue compared with men. A study found that women in general have 1.4 times higher chance of complaining of fatigue than men [@fjell2008perceived]. However, females are found to have longer sleeping hours than their male counterparts of the same race [@lauderdale2006objectively]. In that study, it was found that the mean sleep hours for white females was 6.7 hours compared with 6.1 hours for white males, and 5.9 hours for black female compared with 5.1 hours for black males even after adjusting for socioeconomic status, lifestyle and sleep apnea [@lauderdale2006objectively]. Gender differences are huge in terms of working conditions. Females had significantly fewer working hours per week, with 47 hours versus 52 hours per week [@rotenberg2008gender]. In general, women tend to work fewer hours within a week but are more prone to feel fatigue and have a higher risk of traffic incidences.


### Traffic

Although it is generally believed that lower **speed limits** can reduce the chances of traffic crashes, studies on speed limits and traffic fatalities showed inconsistent results [@neeley2009effect; @korkut2010freeway; @zhu2011comprehensive; @davis2015longitudinal]. 

Speed [@tseng2016comprehensive].

For example, based on multinomial logit and negative binomial models, @dong2017estimating used vehicle and driver characteristics, traffic, environment, and road geometry to predict the frequency and severity of large truck-involved crashes. 

@liu2018predicting used artificial neural network classification and regression tree, and support vector machine to predict crash rate levels of motor carriers.

### Weather

[@naik2016weather]

Weather has both direct and indirect effects on drivers’ safety critical events. On one hand, the increase of ambient temperature places risks on drivers’ occupational safety, and possibly leads to cognition loss, heat stroke, and impairment of wakefulness. Evidence showed that the risk of mistakes and safety critical events increase in hot weather [@kjellstrom2009direct; @basagana2015high]. Leard and Roth found that for a day with temperature above 80◦F there is a 9.5% increase in fatality rates compared with a day at 50-60 F [@leard2015weather]. A literature review found that 11 out of 13 studies indicated an increase in unintentional injuries associated with high temperatures [@im2016impact]. On the other hand, real-time extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, storm, and snow can either impair the driver’s visual capability or reduce the safety of driving on the road [@chang2005data; @al2007experimental; @baker1992wind]. It is to noted that the cumulative time of driving in such extreme weather conditions could increase the chances of safety critical events. Studies that explore the association between precipitation and driving safety critical events consistently find a negative relationship. The positive linear relationship between precipitation and traffic accidents can be observed in both driver accidents and pedestrian accidents [@al2007experimental; @graham2003spatial]. Abdel-Aty et al. used detector and sensor data to successfully predict more than 70% of accidents with low visibility conditions [@abdel2012real]. The common problem for the literature exploring the relationship between ambient weather and safety driving critical events is the failure to include the cumulative effect of weather conditions. Instead, they all use an indicator variable to represent whether extreme weather happened during the trip or not, which could lead to potential bias in prediction models.
